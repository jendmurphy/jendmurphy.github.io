Enter the alternate reality of PhD-land.  After a long time (and I mean decades) I'm finally doing it.  A PhD.  In something interesting.  With a real supervisor, and a pile of dirty coffee mugs and everything.  For now, its just a case of reading, learning, more reading and trying to get the hang of my site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  Thank goodness for online tutorials.

Credit where credit is due - this is where I got myself going, and this site is developed from code found here.  Clear instructions and code that copies and pastes easily.  http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css
