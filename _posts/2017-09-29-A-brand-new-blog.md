Enter the alternate reality of PhD-land.  After a long time (and I mean decades) I'm finally doing it.  A PhD.  In something interesting.  With a real supervisor, and a pile of dirty coffee mugs and everything.  For now, its just a case of reading, learning, more reading and trying to get the hang of my site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  Thank goodness for online tutotorials.
