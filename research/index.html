<h1> My Research</h1>

<p>In 2016, Â£6bn of health and social care funding was devolved to the Greater Manchester area.  The Greater Manchester Health and Social Care partnership is a body made up of 37 organisations in the Greater Manchester area charged with overseeing this budget and the devolution process.  Greater Manchester suffers higher poverty and worse health outcomes than many areas within England and the partnership has set stretching targets to radically improve the health outcomes for citizens of the city region.  </p><br/>

<p>My research will use new forms of data to evaluate impact of devolution and is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council through the Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training, providing postgraduate research and training  across Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester Universities.  </p><br/>

<p>I'm privilleged to be supervised by Kingsley Purdham, Matthew Dutton and Aneez Esmail</p><br/>
