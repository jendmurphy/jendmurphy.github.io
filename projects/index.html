<p>Learning to code is a work in progress...projects are hosted on github, and you'll see that things are getting tidier, more efficient and more complicated!  Feel free to fork away.  Most recent projects are listed at the top.</p>

<a href = "https://github.com/jendmurphy/ENVS615-Analysis-of-Human-Dynamics/blob/master/Liverpool%20Data%20Module.ipynb"><h2>ENVS615: Analysis of Human Dynamics</h2></a>

<p>How should I decide where to live?  A data driven model for predicting house prices.  I never thought I would say it, but the coding is getting easier by the way!  Files and jupyter notebook all held here.</p></br>

<p>After the first foray, here's a link to the assessed work.  A script for reading in, manipulating, and visualising a small publicly available health dataset.</p></br>

<a href = "https://github.com/jendmurphy/GEOG5995_Agent-based-models"><h2>GEOG5995 Agent Based Model Course Practical</h2></a>

<p>Click on the title to go to the repository for my first ever forage into the world of Python.  Code here for an agent based model where agents move around an environment, nibbling away at data and building up stores.  Some cooperative behaviour is included whereby nearby agents share their stores, contingent on a defined neighbourhood (a measure of proximity).  The code is animated to allow the user to see the gradual errosion of data through the random movement of agents.  This can be seen by a change in the colour of the underlying environment in the wake of each agent. The repository also includes a pdf UML diagram for the model.</br>

The course was taught by <a href = "https://github.com/AJEvans">Andy Evans</a> of <a href = "http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans/">Leeds University</a>.</p></br>
